Below is the text from an official letter of recommendation I received from Jessica Cox. You can view the original letter [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15cFoBIbG7-EmXWUMmVzj_KjlbFT-DmX2/view?usp=sharing)

To whom it may concern,

I am delighted to recommend Race Ross, a recent graduate from Oregon Tech with a
degree in Mechanical Engineering, who has made significant contributions to
Rightfooted Foundation International's (RFI) groundbreaking Aviation program,
specifically in developing "The Impossible Airplane." This project is a cornerstone of
RFI's mission, symbolizing the limitless potential and societal contributions of
individuals with disabilities.

Race was instrumental in a pivotal project initiative: designing a motorized door for an
aircraft that can be operated with feet. This innovation is a much needed feature for
pilots with disabilities, which will enable greater accessibility and independence. Born
without arms myself, I understand deeply the significance of such advancements, and
Race's work directly contributes to expanding possibilities for people like me to engage
in aviation.

His role involved meticulous coordination with his team and professional engineers
from Van's Aircraft to incorporate motors that could efficiently lock, unlock, and operate
the aircraft's door. Race's technical skills, combined with a creative and inclusive
approach to engineering, were key in overcoming the unique challenges this project
presented.

Beyond his technical contributions, Race demonstrated exceptional commitment and
enthusiasm by volunteering at AirVenture 2023. Here, he engaged with attendees,
explaining the innovative door design and its importance for inclusivity in aviation. His
dedication to sharing the project's vision and details was instrumental in fostering
greater understanding and support for our mission.

Race's blend of technical expertise, teamwork, and advocacy skills makes him an
exemplary candidate for any organization looking to make meaningful impacts. His
work with RFI showcases his ability to contribute significantly to projects that require
both innovative thinking and a deep commitment to societal advancement.

Race Ross's contributions to RFI and his proven ability to apply his engineering skills
toward meaningful, inclusive solutions speak volumes of his character and potential. I
am confident that he will bring the same level of dedication, innovation, and excellence
to your organization.

Sincerely,
Jessica Cox
Executive Director, Rightfooted Foundation International
